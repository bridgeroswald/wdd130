      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        Networking, Social Media, Cable Management, Server Management, Remote Support

        this page will feature a gallery of images of projects that I have completed with descriptions of each project. 

        Example: 
        Networking 
        After visiting a client store which was having Internet issues, I went into their server room and looked at the mess of cables that the room had been turned into. THe trouble with cable problems can start when an organnization grows and grows without a infastructure put in place to handle growth. We took the room apart and fed the cables and fixed the issues by knowing where each of the cables went and what they did. This is so important so our business can understand what needs to happen if something fails and have room to grow. 

        Example 2 
        Office efficiency and comfort
        It is very important to have happy employees and therefore, those who are stuck at a computer need to have a nice workspace that they can enjoy working at. I was able to add a standing desk attachment and create a docking method for the user to use their laptop for all that they need instead of using their laptop and desktop computer. User ease is crucial to a business.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
               My favorite thing in the world is a smile and I believe it goes a long way. 

        I am originally from Rigby Idaho and loved everything that Idaho brought for me in the outdoors. My hobbies include boating, tennis, singing, snowmobiling, and Drone Photography. I love the change in seasons and the new light that it brings to the world. I have recently gotten married to my sweet wife and am currently finishing my Bachelors degree in Computer Information Technology. I do stay busy by keeping a 4.0 in college and I have set the course to graduate in under 2 years from when I started college in 2021. I will have my degree in July 2023 and am looking forward to the opportunities that await me and the benefit that I can be to the companies that I support. 
      
      
        Then I will have an acordian style menu with all of my jobs and descriptions and contact information for each one. 
        Careers, Jobs, and many Opportunities

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The home page will have color and everything added in the css. This page is to be very clean and then direct clients to the other pages. 
      </p>
      <img src="images/home-page.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>         
        The portfolio page is the most important of the website and will house the detailed information about jobs that I am specializing in and those that I have done in the past. It will be mainly text and images to demonstrate skills. 
      </p>
      <img src="images/portfolio-page.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>         
        The about me page is very crucial as it will hold a large amount of very important data that qualifies me as an employee. The majority of this page will be inside of an acordian style resume with all of the detailed information that I will provide about the jobs that I have worked and how they have helped me to grow. 
      </p>
      <img src="images/about-me.png" alt="page 3 wireframe">


      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>    The contact page will be very basic and may not be finished perfectly for this assignment but will be operational soon. This class has created a desire in me to create a place where I can host my information for employers to see.
