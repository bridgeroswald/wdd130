        <h1>Networking</h1>
    <p>
        Connection is a requirement in the world today and that ranges from Secure to Unsecure and fast to slow.

There are many opportunities that a business has to grow and improve on their existing infrastructure and one of the ways that is often looked over is Networking. 
I have experience in the majority of fields used in the field today and it is important to me that I know where you stand on keeping your company secure and available while keeping your budget low. 

My skills range from User Devices to Server Equipment and I have specialties in remote wired and wireless network management.

            <h1>Social Media Management and Design</h1>
        <p>
            Many companies rely on advertisements to get their name out into the crowd and Social media is the Billboard of the day that can get your name on the map. After years of working with Social media on the creator and management side, I can say that it is not easy to run your own business and keep all of your pages active. It is crucial to interact and push useable and needed information to your followers and that is easier now than ever before if you know how to use Social Media properly. 

I emphasize in Facebook, Instagram, and Google and I have a strong background in the Advertisement world and targeting individuals who are interested in your product and don't even know it yet.

                <h1>Cable Managment</h1>
            <p>
                Whether you have a big or small business, presentation is always going to be a priority. Cable management is a skill that I have learned and known to help any desk, workstation, server room, and so much more find ease in organization. 
Have you ever tried to find a cable and never known where it actually leads to? If you manage all correctly, you should be able to look at a cable and immediately know its purpose and where it goes. I find this to be very important especially for businesses who use remote support and you will find that your workspace will look better and your team will be happier as you take the time and manage your cables.   </p>

                <p>
                    No matter what type of Business you run, there will be a time that technology will fail and something will stop working as it should. Some companies have IT personnel who walk from computer to computer fixing issues. 

                    Today, there is a better solution that could help your business and your wallet as your team needs support. Remote support has become more and more available and is a very important to get your team back up and running faster than ever before. There should be little downtime and should take as long as a simple phone call to fix the majority of your issues. 
                    
                    After working support for several years now, I know how important it is to get your team back up and running and I know that as I can help your organization, I will learn how to best help you to stay online and happy every time you turn on your computer.
