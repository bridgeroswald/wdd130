<h1>Bridger Oswald</h1>
<p>My favorite thing in the world is a smile and I believe it goes a long way. 

    I am originally from Rigby Idaho and loved everything that Idaho brought for me in the outdoors. My hobbies include boating, tennis, singing, snowmobiling, and Drone Photography. I love the change in seasons and the new light that it brings to the world. I have recently gotten married to my sweet wife and am currently finishing my Bachelors degree in Computer Information Technology. I do stay busy by keeping a 4.0 in college and I have set the course to graduate in under 2 years from when I started college in 2021. I will have my degree in July 2023 and am looking forward to the opportunities that await me and the benefit that I can be to the companies that I support.  </p>

I learned how to build online forms to submit documentation and store information in an effective way that allowed for the convinence of the client and manager. Each month a total miles driven was required to be manually input from a mileage log that was submitted and I created a submission system where it could be exported to a spreadsheet and easily typed into the Microsoft Dynamics Program.

I was elected the head of the camp when I was a junior and then at the end, was offered a position to come back the following year as a paid social media mentor. This was given to 4 students to be split up and manage each of the 2 sessions. I was the lead and worked under the director and created the videos for the camps. We were to use social media and help parents know about their children and share the information that they were learning. This gave me the opportunity to use my photography and Social Media skills and find out even more how much I love both fields. We worked and created advertisments for the program and made sure the information was properly written and recorded for the records of the camp. I loved every long day and the many opportunities that I experienced. </p>
